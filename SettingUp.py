Create a new Flask project and set up a virtual environment:
Use virtualenv or venv to create an isolated environment for your project.
bash


python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:
Activate the virtual environment based on your operating system.
bash


# Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# Linux/MacOS
source venv/bin/activate
Install necessary packages:
Install Flask, Flask-Marshmallow, and MySQL connector using pip.
bash


pip install Flask Flask-Marshmallow mysql-connector-python
Establish a connection to your MySQL database:
Configure the database connection in your Flask application and use the Members table.
python


from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from flask_marshmallow import Marshmallow
import mysql.connector

app = Flask(__name__)
ma = Marshmallow(app)

def connect_to_db():
    """Establishes a connection to the MySQL database."""
    return mysql.connector.connect(
        host="localhost",
        user="yourusername",
        password="yourpassword",
        database="fitness_center"
    )
Expected Outcome: A Flask project with a connected database and the required tables created.
